## Surface analysis tool
### - Why would you want to use this tool?
Once you're planning doing field work or you want to familiarize with an specific location, understanding the landscape is fundamental to determine next steps in your project. If you work with projects in different sites, it can get really annoying and tedious to generate DEMs, slope, curvature and aspect rasters each time. It is nice to be able to do it all with just one command, instead of using each time different tools in differents GUIs.
